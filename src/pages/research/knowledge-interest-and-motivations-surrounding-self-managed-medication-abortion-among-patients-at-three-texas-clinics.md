## About the study

We examined patientsâ€™ knowledge of, interest in, and experience with self-managed medication abortion before presenting to one of 3 Texas clinics. We characterized the clinic- and person-level factors associated with these measures. 

## Key findings

* Of patients at 3 Texas clinics, 30% had prior knowledge of medications that
  could be used to self-manage an abortion. Among these, 28% had considered
  medication self-management before attending the clinic.
* In all, 13% of patients sought or attempted any method of self-management
  before attending the clinic.
* Those experiencing clinic-access barriers were more likely to have considered
  or attempted self-management.
* Among patients without prior knowledge of medication self-management,
  39% expressed interest in this option as an alternative to in-clinic care.
