## Background 
I will soon complete my PhD in Sociology with a specialization in Demography at the University of Texas at Austin. 

Because I am interested in the ways institutions and policies shape people's experiences of their bodies and healthcare, my research is transnational, spanning social and political contexts across 5 continents. For my dissertation, I designed and implemented an original survey, conducted in-depth interviews, and analyzed longitudinal data to explore people’s attitudes and decision-making processes surrounding reproduction and formal healthcare. 

My research as been supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the Society of Family Planning.  My work appears in *[Social Science and Medicine,](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112686)* *[Population Studies](https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2020.1737188),[ Contraception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782419303920?via%3Dihub), [Americ​an Journal of Public Health](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305369), [Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1363/psrh.12073), [AJOG](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.026),* and* [BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://srh.bmj.com/content/44/3/181).* Outside of academia, my research has also been featured in major news outlets, including [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/upshot/abortion-pills-rising-use.html), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/07/after-abortion-is-illegal/565430/), and [Wired.](https://www.wired.com/story/telemedicine-could-help-fill-the-gaps-in-americas-abortion-care/)
