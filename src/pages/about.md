## Kathleen Broussard

I am currently a PhD candidate in Sociology with a specialization in Demography at the University of Texas at Austin.

For my dissertation, I designed and implemented an original survey, conducted in-depth interviews, and analyzed longitudinal data to explore people’s attitudes and decision-making processes surrounding reproduction and formal healthcare. Because I am interested in how broader social structures shape people's experiences of and attitudes towards medicine, I take a transnational approach, exploring women's lived experience across social and political contexts in the U.S., Latin America, Europe, and Sub-Saharan Africa.

My research as been supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the Society of Family Planning. My work appears in *[Social Science and Medicine,](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112686)* *[Population Studies](https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2020.1737188), [Contraception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782419303920?via%3Dihub), [Americ​an Journal of Public Health](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305369), [Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1363/psrh.12073), [AJOG](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.026),* and _[BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://srh.bmj.com/content/44/3/181)._
