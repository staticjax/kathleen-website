## Kathleen Broussard

Prior to beginning my PhD at UT Austin, I received a Master's degree from the University of Chicago and spent two years living in Kansas and Georgia, where I provided services for survivors of sexual violence as a Victim Advocate for the U.S. Army.   

Outside of work, you can find me at home with my family, gardening or tending to our backyard flock of chickens and ducks.
