My research spans countries across 5 continents, including the United States, Peru, Malawi, India, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. I use a range of tools (surveys, interviews, content analysis) to explore people’s attitudes and decision-making processes surrounding contraception, abortion, and childbearing. 

I have been funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the Society of Family Planning.  My work appears in *[Social Science and Medicine,](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112686)* *[Population Studies](https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2020.1737188),[ Contraception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782419303920?via%3Dihub), [Americ​an Journal of Public Health](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305369), [Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1363/psrh.12073), [AJOG](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.026),* and* [BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://srh.bmj.com/content/44/3/181).* Outside of academia, my research has also been featured in major news outlets, including [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/upshot/abortion-pills-rising-use.html), [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/07/after-abortion-is-illegal/565430/), and [Wired.](https://www.wired.com/story/telemedicine-could-help-fill-the-gaps-in-americas-abortion-care/)
