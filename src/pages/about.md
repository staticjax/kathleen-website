## Kathleen Broussard

Prior to moving to South Carolina, I completed my PhD at UT Austin and MA at the University of Chicago. I'm a native Texan, but I previously lived in Kansas and Georgia, where I provided services for survivors of sexual violence as a Victim Advocate for the U.S. Army. 

Outside of the office and classroom, you can find me hiking in the woods, gardening, or at home with my family.
