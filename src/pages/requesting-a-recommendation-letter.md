Below is information about my letter of recommendation (LOR) policy. Please read all of it. I am happy to discuss writing a LOR with any student who has: 

1. completed and excelled in one of my courses

2﻿. worked with me in a research capacity

3. previously received my mentorship for their thesis or dissertation

Students interested in requesting a LOR need to be aware of the following: 

**Part I:** For undergraduates considering graduate school of any kind

Research the programs, fellowship, faculty, etc to ensure they are a good fit for you. It does not make sense for you to apply to programs where your interests do not match the program’s area and faculty expertise. 

**Part II:** For doctoral students applying for faculty positions/other jobs 

Only apply to positions in places you would consider moving. Sometimes you don’t always know this in advance, and that’s okay, but don’t apply to jobs you know you would never accept. 

Set your salary expectations early. Conduct informational interviews with people in your industry/discipline. Faculty salaries for public institutions are often publicly available online. You can also see average salaries compiled by the AAUP according to institution type and rank. 

Research the programs, fellowship, etc to ensure they are a good fit. It does not make sense for you to apply to programs where your interests do not match the program’s areas/faculty expertise. 

Consider what you can do best to provide me a dossier that gives me a sense of you as a candidate for positions. What will best help me recommend you to become a future member of the professoriate or other sector?

**How to submit a request for a LOR**

I will only write letters that are confidential and where students have signed the release that is required to maintain that confidentiality. I will also only email/upload letters to schools/organizations, not to individual students. This is a blanket policy designed to protect the integrity of recommendation letters, not the content of any particular letter. 

If you have taken a course that I taught, I will only write a letter if you received a 90% or higher for your overall grade *and* your attendance grade. Overall grades of B or higher will be considered if you maintained an attendance grade of 90% or higher. (Feel free to discuss this with me in the case of extenuating circumstances, family needs, medical leave, etc)

The earliest I will submit a letter is three weeks after you provide me all the information requested in the dossier. This does not include holidays (i.e., add extra days to the timeline). That means if you ask me for a letter three months ahead of time, but you do not email me the items above until three days before the deadline, the earliest you can expect I will submit the letter will be about three weeks after the deadline. While some applications are flexible about faculty deadlines, others are not and fully close their recommendation portal. So, start early.

Consider whether I am the best person to write a letter for you. Considerations in reaching this determination include:

How much contact you have had with me (i.e., one or multiple courses, spoken with me in office hours, completed an independent research project with me, etc.)? If you have not had that much contact with me, there are only so many things I can write about; a student in this situation may want to locate a professor with whom they have had more contact. 

Will a letter of recommendation from a Sociology faculty member help the student's application? If a student is applying to graduate school in Sociology, then a letter from a faculty member in Sociology will be very important. However, if the student is applying to a Physics program, to certain types of business schools, etc. then a letter from a Sociology faculty member may only be marginally helpful. 

How well did you perform in my course? Instructions for letters of recommendation usually request that faculty comment on the relative achievement of students (i.e., "Student X scored in the top 5% of the final grades..."). 
If you have not taken courses with me, how did you perform in the settings in which we did interact? For example, if you were a Research Assistant, would you say you were timely? Creative? Collaborative? Worked well independently? Provide examples. If I am on your committee, what role did I end up playing (in your view?) 

**Application dossier (long document + spreadsheet)**

Gather ALL the items listed below. Put them in order and create ONE long document (MS Word or PDF).  Title the document: Lastname_Firstname_LORrequest_Due date of first letter (e.g., “Doe_Jane_LORrequest_1JAN2023”). Then email me the ONE document and spreadsheet. This may seem a minor detail but keep in mind I get many requests–having all your materials in one document ensures I have what I need in one place). 

*The long document*

* Your preferred first and last name (note whether this is different from name on your transcript) 
* Your gender pronouns 
* Photo (if you are no longer a student at USC and we have not recently seen one another)
  Our contact: When did you attend office hours? Did we work on a project?
* Course information: 

  \-For each course you took with me provide
  name of course and year/semester that you enrolled.

  \-﻿ Your final grade

  \-﻿ Topics and main arguments of papers (if possible); your strengths in the course 
* Interests and Strengths: Please answer in one or two sentences:

  \-Why did you choose the program you are applying to and how did you become interested in it?

  \-What are your experiences relevant to this field? (work, internship, academic)

  \-What strengths will help you in this field?
* A draft statement of purpose describing what you are applying for and why you feel you are a good candidate. If you are applying for drastically different types of programs, for example a PhD program and law school, I’ll need your assessment of how both are a fit. For PhD students applying for faculty jobs the equivalent is the draft of the cover letter, the research statement, the teaching statement and/or diversity statement you are submitting. 
* A resume or curriculum vitae 
* (As applicable) For specific fellowships/scholarships, etc, provide the description of opportunity to which you are applying and what the organization list as the criteria for selection. For example, some will say “The review committee is especially interested in applicants who are committed to ABC” or “Main selection criteria is match of the project to the foundation’s three key priorities which are X, Y and Z.” 
* Forms (As applicable): If there are paper forms for me to fill out, fill in as much as you can, scan them, and email them to me. 

*Spreadsheet* <br/>

I﻿f you are requesting more than one LOR, please complete [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c3hRJ0uU9DGjW8SEAec21k_D4mM4UXmk/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118357542871174435514&rtpof=true&sd=true). Fill out each column.


If you have more than 10 graduate programs/fellowships to which you are applying 2) consider if you have really narrowed down programs for fit and b) Use a dossier service for my letter (e.g. Interfolio). I cannot do individual letters for students who are requesting more than 10. 

**My contact information for you to place in the letter request for**

Kathleen Broussard, PhD <br/>
Assistant Professor <br/>

\*Updates: If you remove or add programs to which you are applying, email me an updated Excel sheet with the complete list of programs to which you are applying.

If you decide not to apply, close out the electronic application so I do not receive automated reminders to write letters.

Feel free to email me a reminder one week and then one day before the deadline if you have not heard from me.

Thank you and best of luck!
