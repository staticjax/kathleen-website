We conducted anonymous in-depth interviews with 32 people from 20 states who sought abortion medications online. Participants were asked about their (or their partners’) motivations for considering self-managed abortion, the sources of medications they identified and any other methods they considered.
## Findings & illustrative quotes

* **Seeking abortion medications online can be a response to clinic access barriers in states with restrictive abortion laws and those without** 

*It would be so much easier if abortion were listed, just like every other service they offer in the clinic. So, I Googled ‘medical abortion.’ I came across the site \[of the online telemedicine service], and it seemed like such a cool service where they would mail the medication.*
  
Marianela, 32 years old, California  

* **Self-managed medication abortion can be a preference over obtaining care in a clinic**

*As a woman, you are the authority on your body. You know the best about what your body should feel like. I think I should be able to make the decision as I see fit. I’ve successfully used natural or self-care remedies for many other things in the past. That is why having an at-home abortion makes so much sense to me. I definitely think that at-home abortions should be available to all of us.*  

Janice, 29 years old, Montana 

* **Online options offer either information or medications, but not both** 

*I had no trouble finding information I trusted about what the pills do and how to use them. Those sites also had lots about how you know if something’s not right during the process. But none of these sites could give me the pills!* 

Lorna, 22 years old, South Dakota 

* **The lack of trusted online options can delay care and lead to consideration of ineffective or unsafe alternatives** 

*I looked at home remedies online and saw that vitamin C was the big one. And then the black cohosh, and also vinegar. I was thinking the natural remedies might not be so bad because it wouldn’t be putting extra hormones or chemicals in my body.* 

Gloria, 29 years old, South Carolina
