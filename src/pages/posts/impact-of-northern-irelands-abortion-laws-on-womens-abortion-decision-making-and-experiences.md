## **Findings and illustrative quotes**

**Women in Northern Ireland still experience multiple barriers to travelling to access abortion care even though abortions are now provided free in Great Britain.**

*"Being a single mum of quite a few children I’d have to somehow find childcare. And on top of that I’d have to try to hide it, because there's a massive stigma attached to it in this country. You feel like a criminal no matter what pathway you take."*

*Pamela, 33 years old*

**Self-managed medication abortion using online telemedicine may be preferred over travel due its convenience and safety, but the experience is dominated by fear and isolation due to the risk of prosecution.**

*"There would be such a traumatic side to having to travel instead of being in the comfort of your own home. But I was absolutely frightened. I never slept for weeks tracing that parcel. Oh my god, it was a scary time, and I probably never settled for even a week after receiving it, because I was so scared that the police were going to land on my door … I just thought, my god, is this really what it could actually come to? Where you can get an hour’s flight, and not get into any trouble. But you get it sent to your home and you could be arrested…."*

*Pearl, 36 years old* 

**Lack of clarity surrounding Northern Irish abortion laws delays access to care and fuels mistrust of the healthcare system.**

*My first packet got seized and I went into a state of panic … I rung up Customs and asked them did they know where my package was because it was taking weeks. The person on the phone asked me if I knew that [misoprostol] was a Class A drug…he compared it to heroin. He actually said to me ‘It’s in the same class as heroin’.”* 

*Ruth, 18 years old*  

[Note: Misoprostol is not classed as a Drug of Misuse and is on the WHO List of Essential Medicines.]
