      Hi there! I'm Kathleen, and I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at the
      University of Texas at Austin. My research lies at the intersection of
      reproductive health, medicine, and social policy. I am interested in the
      ways healthcare, medical technologies, and stigma get “under the skin” to
      shape the meaning and experience of sex, pregnancy, and childbearing. 


      My work has been funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Society of Family Planning. You can find my published research in *Social Science and Medicine, Population Studies, Contraception, American Journal of Public Health, Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, AJOG,* and *BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health.* 


      Outside of academia, my research has also been featured in major news outlets, including The *New York Times* and *The Atlantic*.
