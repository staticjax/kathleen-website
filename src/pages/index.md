      My dissertation examines how healthcare and medical technologies get
      “under the skin”—that is, how they influence the meaning and experience of
      sex, pregnancy, and childbearing. 


      My work has been funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Society of Family planning, and has been published in Social Science and Medicine, Population Studies, Contraception, American Journal of Public Health, Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health, AJOG, and BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health. Outside of academia, my research has also been featured in major news outlets, including The New York Times, The Atlantic, and Wired.
