      Hi there! I am Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of South
      Carolina. I study sexual and reproductive health, social demography,
      fertility desires and behaviors, and health policy.


      My recent work examines people's experiences seeking abortion outside of the formal healthcare system. I situate self-managed abortion along the continuum of medicalization, highlighting how medical technology and healthcare provision influence perceptions and beliefs about pain, the body, and the environment where care is received. I also examine how people strategically navigate their social networks to confront and evade stigma and surveillance from their communities, the state, and the formal health care system. 


      M﻿y research appears in *[Journal of Health and Social Behavior](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00221465231215783),[Social Science & Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112686), [Population Studies](https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2020.1737188), [JAMA Network Open](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2803942), [Contraception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782419303920?via%3Dihub), [American Journal of Public Health](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305369), [Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1363/psrh.12073), [American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.026),* and other academic journals. It has been featured across major news outlets, including *[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/upshot/abortion-pills-rising-use.html)* and *[The Atlantic.](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/07/after-abortion-is-illegal/565430/)* In support of my research, I have received funding from the Society of Family Planning, the NICHD, and private foundations. 


      I have also contributed to three collaborative projects:


      * [Project SANA](https://www.projectsana.org/), a nationwide study of self-managed abortion

      * [Texas Policy Evaluation Project](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/txpep/) (TxPEP), which evaluated the impact of reproductive health legislation in Texas

      * [Tsogolo la Thanzi](https://tsogololathanzi.uchicago.edu/) (TLT), a longitudinal study examining young young people's reproductive goals and behaviors amidst an AIDS epidemic in Southern Malawi.


      Prior to joining USC, I completed my Ph.D. in Sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, where I was a fellow at the Population Research Center.
