      Hi there! I'm a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Texas at
      Austin and a fellow at the Population Research Center. My research
      interests include sexual and reproductive health, fertility, gender,
      social networks, and social policy. In my dissertation, I use
      both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the individual,
      social, and structural determinants of fertility, contraceptive use, and
      abortion. My work appears in *[Social Science and
      Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112686),* *[Population
      Studies](https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2020.1737188),[ Contraception](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782419303920?via%3Dihub),
      [American Journal of Public
      Health](https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305369), [Perspectives on Sexual
      and Reproductive
      Health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1363/psrh.12073), [American
      Journal of Obstetrics &
      Gynecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.026),* and *[BMJ Sexual
      and Reproductive Health](https://srh.bmj.com/content/44/3/181).* It has
      also been featured across major news outlets, including *[The New York
      Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/upshot/abortion-pills-rising-use.html)* and *[The
      Atlantic.](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/07/after-abortion-is-illegal/565430/)*
      In support of my research, I was awarded the 2019 Emerging Scholars in
      Family Planning grant from the Society of Family Planning and the NICHD
      Pre-Doctoral Training Fellowship in Demography. Questions that motivate my
      research include:


      * *How do healthcare and medical technologies shape the meaning and experience of pregnancy, abortion, and childbearing?* 

      * *How do people's identities and beliefs influence their engagement with the formal healthcare system?* 

      * *What role do social networks play in informal or stigmatized health-seeking behaviors?* 


      My sole-authored paper in *[Social Science & Medicine](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112686)* responds to these questions through an analysis of the narratives of 68 women living in two countries where abortion access was highly restricted (Ireland and Northern Ireland). These women either left the country to receive clinic-based care or obtained medications through informal channels to self-manage an abortion at home. In this work, I situate self-managed abortion within the continuum of (de)medicalization and reveal the ways medical technology and healthcare provision shape individual perceptions and beliefs about pain, the body, and the environment where care is received. 


      Beyond my dissertation, I have been a research associate on three collaborative projects: the [Texas Policy Evaluation Project](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/txpep/) (TxPEP), which evaluates the impact of reproductive health legislation; [Project SANA](https://www.projectsana.org/), a study of self-managed abortion in the United States; and [Tsogolo la Thanzi](https://tsogololathanzi.uchicago.edu/) (TLT), a longitudinal study examining young people's reproductive goals and behaviors amidst an AIDS epidemic.
